# Sample that demonstrates Unit and Integration testing

Shows how to test the different layers in an application:
- web (MockMvc)
- service (JUnit + Mockito)
- domain (Junit)
- repository (DataJpaTest)
- rest-integration (MockRestServiceServer)
- integration-test (SpringBootTest)

See the different test-classes for implementation details and comments.


Disclaimer: Simple application with a somewhat over-engineered test-suite in order
to demonstrate different test-concepts.
